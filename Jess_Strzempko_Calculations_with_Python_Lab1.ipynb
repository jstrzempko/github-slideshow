        "This code calculates agricultural land and rain runoff in Kenya. When agricultural land is converted to impervious (or impermeable) surfaces, rainwater runoff tends to increase due to reduced absorption. Increased runoff can have both advantages, such as reuse opportunities, and disadvantages when it results in flooding or landslides. Environmental calculations like these are important to understanding how the landscape will respond to human development with potential negative impacts for the local population. \n",
